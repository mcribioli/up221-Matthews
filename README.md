# Welcome to my Repo!
## About me:
Hello! My name is Matthews(he/him), I'm a first year MURP concentrating on transportation planning and policy. I'm born and raised in Socal (LA -> OC -> LA). I did my undergrad at the University of California, Irvine studying Aerospace Engineering. I have a large interest in transportation, especially in being able to improve public transportation in the US. 

## Course Description
By completeling this course we will be able to:
- Learn the basics of programming in Python.
- Understand the benefits and limtis of using GIS as part of the planning process. 
- Present complex data and analysis in a visual format which is easy for all audiences to understand and interpret. 

## Project Ideas
- Look at the existing and upcoming transit lines which are part of the LA Metro system to predict their success/impact.
- Look at optimal streets (elavation change, road speed, weather, housing/employment density) for bike routes in Los Angeles.
- Use NASA weather, soil, and atmospheric data to determine optimal vegetables and fruits to be planted across california.
- Compare and contrast the conditions (local population densities, layout, demographics, etc) and ridership of different international high speed rail lines and the california HSR to predict success.

## Course Objective
While I have some general experience in Python and creating GIS projects, I never received a formal education in the field. I would love to take the opportunity to use this class to relearn the basics and get a good grasp on the fundamentals of coding and GIS. I would also like to use the final project in this course as part of my resume for future opportunities.
